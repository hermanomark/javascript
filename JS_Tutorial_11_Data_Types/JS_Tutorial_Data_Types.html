<!-- JavaScript Data Types -->

<!-- JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more: -->
<!-- 
var length = 16;                               // Number
var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object  -->
<!-- 
The Concept of Data Types

In programming, data types is an important concept.

To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this: -->

<!-- var x = 16 + "Volvo";

Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

JavaScript will treat the example above as:
var x = "16" + "Volvo";
 -->

 <!-- When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. -->

 <h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 16 + "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results: -->

<p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</p>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".

In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings. -->

<!-- JavaScript Types are Dynamic.

JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types: -->

<p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:</p>

<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
var x;               // Now x is undefined
x = 5;               // Now x is a Number
x = "John";          // Now x is a String

document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Strings

A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes: -->

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';

document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML =
carName1 + "<br>" + 
carName2; 
</script>

<!-- You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: -->

<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
var answer1 = "It's alright";
var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
answer1 + "<br>" + 
answer2 + "<br>" + 
answer3;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals: -->

<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

<p id="demo6"></p>

<script>
var x1 = 34.00;
var x2 = 34;
var x3 = 3.14;

document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML =
x1 + "<br>" + x2 + "<br>" + x3;
</script>

<!-- Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation: -->

<p>Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:</p>

<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
var y = 123e5;
var z = 123e-5;

document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML =
y + "<br>" + z;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Booleans

Booleans can only have two values: true or false. -->

<p>Booleans can have two values: true or false:</p>

<p id="demo8"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML =
(x == y) + "<br>" + (x == z);
</script>

<!-- Booleans are often used in conditional testing. -->

<!-- JavaScript Arrays

JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names): -->


<h2>JavaScript Arrays</h2>

<p>Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0].</p>

<p id="demo9"></p>

<script>
var cars = ["Saab","Volvo","BMW"];

document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = cars[0];
</script>

<!-- Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on. -->

<!-- JavaScript Objects

JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas. -->

<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p id="demo10"></p>

<script>
var person = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName  : "Doe",
    age       : 50,
    eyeColor  : "blue"
};

document.getElementById("demo10").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<!-- The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor. -->
<!-- 
The typeof Operator

You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression: -->

<h2>JavaScript typeof</h2>
<p>The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.</p>

<p id="demo11"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo11").innerHTML = 
typeof "" + "<br>" +
typeof "John" + "<br>" + 
typeof "John Doe";
</script>

<p>The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.</p>

<p id="demo12"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo12").innerHTML = 
typeof 0 + "<br>" + 
typeof 314 + "<br>" +
typeof 3.14 + "<br>" +
typeof (3) + "<br>" +
typeof (3 + 4);
</script>

<!-- Undefined

In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined. -->

<p>The value (and the data type) of a variable with no value is <b>undefined</b>.</p>

<p id="demo13"></p>

<script>
var car;
document.getElementById("demo13").innerHTML =
car + "<br>" + typeof car;
</script>

<!-- Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined. -->

<p>Variables can be emptied if you set the value to <b>undefined</b>.</p>

<p id="demo14"></p>

<script>
var car = "Volvo";
car = undefined;
document.getElementById("demo14").innerHTML =
car + "<br>" + typeof car;
</script>

<!-- Empty Values

An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

An empty string has both a legal value and a type. -->

<p>An empty string has both a legal value and a type:</p>

<p id="demo15"></p>

<script>
var car = "";
document.getElementById("demo15").innerHTML =
"The value is: " +
car + "<br>" +
"The type is: " + typeof car;
</script>

<!-- Null

In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.

You can empty an object by setting it to null: -->

<p>Objects can be emptied by setting the value to <b>null</b>.</p>

<p id="demo16"></p>

<script>
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;
document.getElementById("demo16").innerHTML = typeof person;
</script>


<p>Objects can be emptied by setting the value to <b>undefined</b>.</p>

<p id="demo17"></p>

<script>
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = undefined;
document.getElementById("demo17").innerHTML = person;
</script>

<!-- Difference Between Undefined and Null

Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:
 -->

 <p>Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:</p>

<p id="demo18"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo18").innerHTML =
typeof undefined + "<br>" +
typeof null + "<br><br>" +
(null === undefined) + "<br>" +
(null == undefined);
</script>


<!-- Primitive Data

A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods.

The typeof operator can return one of these primitive types:

    string
    number
    boolean
    undefined
 -->

<p>The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.</p>

<p id="demo19"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo19").innerHTML = 
typeof "john" + "<br>" + 
typeof 3.14 + "<br>" +
typeof true + "<br>" +
typeof false + "<br>" +
typeof x;
</script>

<!-- Complex Data

The typeof operator can return one of two complex types:

    function
    object

The typeof operator returns object for both objects, arrays, and null.

The typeof operator does not return object for functions. -->

<p>The typeof operator returns object for both objects, arrays, and null.</p>
<p>The typeof operator does not return object for functions.</p>

<p id="demo20"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo20").innerHTML = 
typeof {name:'john', age:34} + "<br>" +
typeof [1,2,3,4] + "<br>" +
typeof null + "<br>" +
typeof function myFunc(){};
</script>

<!-- The typeof operator returns "object" for arrays because in JavaScript arrays are objects. -->
