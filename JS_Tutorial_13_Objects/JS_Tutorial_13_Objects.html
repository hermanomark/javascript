<!-- Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods

In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop: -->

<!-- Object  

Car

Properties 
  
car.name = Fiat

car.model = 500

car.weight = 850kg

car.color = white   

 Methods

car.start()

car.drive()

car.brake()

car.stop() -->

<!-- All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times. -->

<!-- JavaScript Objects

You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:  -->

<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
// Create and display a variable:
var car = "Fiat";
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = car;
</script>

<!-- Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car: -->

<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = car.color + " " + car.type;
</script>

<!-- The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
 -->

<!--  Object Definition

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal: -->

<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<!-- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:  -->

<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName  : "Doe",
    age       : 50,
    eyeColor  : "blue"
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

<!-- Object Properties

The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties: -->

<!-- Property    Property Value
firstName   John
lastName    Doe
age         50
eyeColor    blue -->

<!-- Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties in two ways:
objectName.propertyName

or
objectName["propertyName"]
 -->

 <p>There are two different ways to access an object property.</p>

<p>You can use person.property or person["property"].</p>

<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       :  5566
};
// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
</script>

<p id="demo6"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       :  5566
};
// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML =
person["firstName"] + " " + person["lastName"];
</script>


<!-- Object Methods

Objects can also have methods.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions. -->
<!-- 
Property    Property Value
firstName   John
lastName    Doe
age         50
eyeColor    blue
fullName    function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;} -->

<!-- A method is a function stored as a property. -->

<!-- Example
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}; -->

<!-- The this Keyword

In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object. -->

<!-- Accessing Object Methods

You access an object method with the following syntax: -->

<!-- objectName.methodName() -->

<p>An object method is a function definition, stored as a property value.</p>

<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
       return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
};
// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>

<!-- If you access a method without (), it will return the function definition: -->

<p>If you access an object method without (), it will return the function definition:</p>

<p id="demo8"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
       return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
};

// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = person.fullName;
</script>

<!-- Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:
var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object

Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.

You will learn more about objects later in this tutorial.
