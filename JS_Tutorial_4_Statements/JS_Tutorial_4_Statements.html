<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo_es6"> </p>

<script>

var x, y, z;  // Statement 1
x = 5;        // Statement 2
y = 6;        // Statement 3
z = x + y;    // Statement 4

document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "The value of z is " + z + ".";
document.getElementById("demo_es6").innerHTML = `The value of z is ${z}.`; // You can print in also in JS ES6.

<!-- 
JavaScript Programs

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. -->

<!-- In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser. -->

<!-- JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo": -->

<p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
</script>

<!-- Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. -->

<!-- The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written. -->

<!-- JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.  -->

<!-- Semicolons ; -->

<!-- Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. -->

<!-- Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:  -->

<p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>

<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
var a, b, c;
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = c;
</script>

<!-- When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: -->

<p>Multiple statements on one line is allowed.</p>

<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
var a, b, c;
var a = 1; b = 2; c = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = c;
</script>

<!-- On the web, you might see examples without semicolons. -->
<!-- Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended. -->

<!-- JavaScript White Space -->

<!-- JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. -->

<!-- The following lines are equivalent: -->

<!-- var person = "Hege";
var person="Hege"; -->

<!-- A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ): -->

<!-- var x = y + z;  -->

<!-- JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks -->

<!-- For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. -->

<!-- If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator: -->

<p>
The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
</p>

<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: -->

<p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo6"></p>
<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
</script>

<!-- In this tutorial we use 4 spaces of indentation for code blocks.
You will learn more about functions later in this tutorial. -->

<!-- JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:  -->

<!-- Keyword   Description
break   Terminates a switch or a loop
continue  Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top
debugger  Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function
do ... while  Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true
for   Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
function  Declares a function
if ... else   Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition
return  Exits a function
switch  Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
try ... catch   Implements error handling to a block of statements
var   Declares a variable

JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables. -->
