<!-- JavaScript Syntax -->

<!-- JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed: -->

<!--  var x, y;          // How to declare variables
x = 5; y = 6;      // How to assign values
z = x + y;         // How to compute values  -->

<!-- JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values. -->

<!-- Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables. -->

<!-- JavaScript Literals

The most important rules for writing fixed values are:

Numbers are written with or without decimals: -->

<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Number can be written with or without decimals.</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = 10.50;
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 1005;
</script>

<!-- Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: -->

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings can be written with double or single quotes.</p>

<p id="demo3"></p>
<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = 'John Doe';
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = "John Doe";
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6: -->

<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In this example, x is defined as a variable.
Then, x is assigned the value of 6:</p>

<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
var x;
x = 6;
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Operators -->

<!-- JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - *  / ) to compute values:  -->

<h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>

<p>JavaScript uses arithmetic operators to compute values (just like algebra).</p>

<p id="demo6"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = (5 + 6) * 10;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:  -->

<h2>Assigning JavaScript Values</h2>

<p>In JavaScript the = operator is used to assign values to variables.</p>

<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
var x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = x + y;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation. -->

<!-- For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50: -->

<h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>

<p>Expressions compute to values.</p>

<p id="demo8"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = 5 * 10;
</script>

<!-- Expressions can also contain variable values: -->

<p id="demo9"></p>

<script>
var x;
x = 5;
document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = x * 10;
</script>

<!-- The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. -->

<!-- For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe": -->

<p id="demo10"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo10").innerHTML = "John" + " "  + "Doe";
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The var keyword tells the browser to create variables: -->

<h2>The var Keyword Creates Variables</h2>

<p id="demo11"></p>

<script>
var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
document.getElementById("demo11").innerHTML = y;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed: -->

<h2>JavaScript Comments are NOT Executed</h2>

<p id="demo12"></p>

<script>
var x;
x = 5;
// x = 6; I will not be executed
document.getElementById("demo12").innerHTML = x;
</script>


<!-- JavaScript Identifiers

Identifiers are names.

In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.

In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. -->

<!-- Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.  -->

<!-- JavaScript is Case Sensitive -->

<!-- All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables. -->

<h2>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</h2>

<p>Try change lastName to lastname.</p>

<p id="demo13"></p>

<script>
var lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
document.getElementById("demo13").innerHTML = lastName;
</script>

<!-- JavaScript does not interpret VAR or Var as the keyword var. -->

<!-- JavaScript and Camel Case -->

<!-- Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions. -->

<!-- Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
 -->

<!-- Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity. -->

<!-- JavaScript Character Set

JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
