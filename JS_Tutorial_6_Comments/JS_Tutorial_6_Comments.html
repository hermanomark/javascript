<!-- JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
 -->

 <!-- Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line: -->

<h1 id="myH"></h1>
<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comments are not executed.</p>

<!-- This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code: -->

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
var y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2 

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y; // Write y to demo
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comments are not executed.</p>

<!-- Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code: -->

<h1 id="myH1"></h1>
<p id="myP1"></p>

<script>
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myp"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH1").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP1").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comment block is not executed.</p>

<!-- It is most common to use single line comments.
Block comments are often used for formal documentation. -->

<!-- Using Comments to Prevent Execution

Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.

This example uses // to prevent execution of one of the code lines: -->

<h1 id="myH2"></h1>

<p id="myP2"></p>

<script>
//document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP2").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comment is not executed.</p>

<!-- This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of multiple lines: -->

<h1 id="myH3"></h1>

<p id="myP3"></p>

<script>
/*
document.getElementById("myH3").innerHTML = "Welcome to my Homepage";
document.getElementById("myP3").innerHTML = "This is my first paragraph.";
*/
</script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The comment-block is not executed.</p>
