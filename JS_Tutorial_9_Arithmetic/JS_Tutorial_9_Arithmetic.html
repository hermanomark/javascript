<!-- JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

<!-- Arithmetic Operations

A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals: -->

<p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers and produces a new number.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 100 + 50;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- or variables: -->

<p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or variables) and produces a new number.</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
var a = 100;
var b = 50;
var x = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- or expressions: -->

<p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or expressions) and produces a new number.</p>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
var a = 3;
var x = (100 + 50) * a;
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- Operators and Operands

The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.
Operand   Operator  Operand
100   +   50
Adding

The addition operator (+) adds numbers: -->

<h2>The + Operator</h2>

<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- Subtracting

The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers. -->

<h2>The - Operator</h2>

<p id="demo4"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x - y;
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = z
</script>


<!-- Multiplying

The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. -->

<h2>The * Operator</h2>

<p id="demo5"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x * y;
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- Dividing

The division operator (/) divides numbers. -->

<h2>The / Operator</h2>

<p id="demo6"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x / y;
document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- Reminder

The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder. -->

<h2>The % Operator</h2>

<p id="demo7"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x % y;
document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder.
In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division.  -->

<!-- Incrementing

The increment operator (++) increments numbers. -->

<h2>The ++ Operator</h2>

<p id="demo8"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
x++;
var z = x;
document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- Decrementing

The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers. -->

<h2>The -- Operator</h2>

<p id="demo9"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
x--;
var z = x;
document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = z;
</script>

<!-- Operator Precedence

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. -->

<p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>

<p id="demo10"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo10").innerHTML = 100 + 50 * 3;
</script>

<!-- Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?

Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses: -->

<p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
<p>But parenthesis has precedence over multiplication.</p>

<p id="demo11"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo11").innerHTML = (100 + 50) * 3;
</script>

<!-- When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first.

When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:  -->

<p>When many operations has the same precedence, they are computed from left to right.</p>

<p id="demo12"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo12").innerHTML = 100 + 50 - 3;
</script>
