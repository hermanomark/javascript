We're gonna build a todo list!
Most of the web application are just like a todo list. e.g. facebook, twiiter, slack etc.
The application will be an ugly todolist because to make it beautiful we're gonna need to learn some css.
5 main features:
1. Ability to create an item
2. Ability to toggle an single item, like marking it for complete or reset it again.
3. Ability to toggle everything at once
4. Ability to edit an item
5. Ability to delete an item
