VI. Functions and Variables
var myName = 'Gordon';

function sayName() {
  var secret = 'watchandcode'
  console.log(myName);
}

sayName(); // will work
console.log(secret); // will not work

If you're inside of a function, you can look out and see data, but the opposite isn't true. If you're outside, you can't look in.

Circles and Arrows - To visualize to avoid referencing errors, draw circle in a function then write an arrow from displaying output to the variable. If displaying output(console.log()) is referencing inside the circle that's a referencing error.

Scope - variable visibility, what viariables you can see at that point.
